				<strong>Why is this site so pinky? Remeber to stand out from the crowd!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
        To be honest pink is not my favorite color. I was looking for a color
        that would make this page stand out from the crowd, so that you could
        remember what to look for when you are ready for a new page? There was
        that nice website creator,that pinky, what was the website adress? ..it
        works this way.

        This is Giro Italia main theme Pink by the way - my favourite cycling
        tour, thank you Giro. Italians are famous for their design. When it
        comes to creation a website for you, lets make it Italian way, stylish,
        modern, fast and .. what is even more important reliable due to use
        modern Javasccript technoogies, React JS, Next JS or exceletn documentet
        and popular Wordpress CMS
